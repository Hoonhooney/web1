    [Intro]
    <br>Nobody pray for me
    <br>It's been that day for me
    <br>Waaaaay (Yeah, yeah!)</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    [Verse 1]
    <br>Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
    <br>Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
    <br>Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
    <br>D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
    <br>Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
    <br>Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
    <br>I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
    <br>Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
    <br>A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
    <br>Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
    <br>If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
    <br>If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
    <br>My left stroke just went viral
    <br>Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
    <br>Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
    <br>It's levels to it, you and I know</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    [Chorus]
    <br>Bitch, be humble (Hol’ up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol’ up, lil', hol’ up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil’, sit down, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    [Verse 2]
    <br>Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
    <br>Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
    <br>Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
    <br>I make a play fucking up your whole life
    <br>I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
    <br>Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
    <br>Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
    <br>Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
    <br>Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
    <br>I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
    <br>I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
    <br>I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
    <br>This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
    <br>Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
    <br>If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
    <br>I'm the realest nigga after all</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    [Chorus]
    <br>Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
    <br>Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
    <br>Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
    <br>Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)</p>
