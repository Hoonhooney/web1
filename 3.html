    [Verse 1]
    <br>Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
    <br>Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
    <br>As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
    <br>My plateau, and also, what defines my name
    <br>First it was Nasty, but times have changed
    <br>Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign is for pain
    <br>I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
    <br>Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
    <br>Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
    <br>That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
    <br>On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
    <br>Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
    <br>Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
    <br>To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
    <br>To the big dogs living large, taking in light
    <br>Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
    <br>It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
    <br>Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
    <br>Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
    <br>And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS</p>

    [Verse 2]
    <br>"Nas is like…" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
    <br>Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
    <br>Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
    <br>Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
    <br>"Nas is like…" Iron Mike, messiah type
    <br>Before the Christ, after the death
    <br>The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
    <br>Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
    <br>Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
    <br>From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
    <br>Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
    <br>Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
    <br>Can't take it with you under this earth
    <br>Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
    <br>They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
    <br>Before my number's called, history's made
    <br>Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
    <br>Making choices that determine my future under the sky
    <br>To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
    <br>It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
    <br>Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
    <br>Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    [Verse 3]
    <br>"Nas is like…" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
    <br>I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
    <br>I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
    <br>Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
    <br>I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
    <br>Always got you, I’m like pop dukes you would cry for
    <br>I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
    <br>Corporate accounts from a rich company
    <br>I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
    <br>Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
    <br>Bulletproof Hummer man
    <br>I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
    <br>I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
    <br>I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
    <br>Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
    <br>Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night, now…</p>
