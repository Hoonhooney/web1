    <p>[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
    <br>Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
    <br>Still waters run deep
    <br>Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
    <br>'99, nigga, guess who's back
    <br>Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
    <br>Oh for sho'
    <br>Yeah
    <br>Check me out</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
    <br>It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
    <br>Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
    <br>â€˜Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
    <br>You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
    <br>Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
    <br>How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
    <br>They wanna know if he still got it
    <br>They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
    <br>(If you ain't up on thangs)
    <br>Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
    <br>Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
    <br>Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
    <br>Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
    <br>Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
    <br>Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
    <br>Since I left ain't too much changed, still</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
    <br>I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
    <br>(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
    <br>Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
    <br>And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
    <br>I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
    <br>(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
    <br>Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
    <br>And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
    <br>Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
    <br>Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
    <br>Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
    <br>He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
    <br>Still, I stay close to the heat
    <br>And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
    <br>My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
    <br>Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
    <br>Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
    <br>I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
    <br>It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
    <br>Since "Turn Off the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
    <br>I'm still at it, after mathematics
    <br>In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
    <br>Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
    <br>I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
    <br>It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
    <br>Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
    <br>Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
    <br>Laid back in the shack, play this track
    <br>I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
    <br>Still (Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl)
    <br>I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
    <br>Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
    <br>(So if you ain't up on thangs)
    <br>Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
    <br>Still got it wrapped like a mummy
    <br>Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
    <br>Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
    <br>Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
    <br>Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
    <br>Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
    <br>Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
    <br>9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
    <br>D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
    <br>Smoke some with your Dogg
    <br>No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
    <br>Some of that real sticky icky icky
    <br>Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
    <br>Boy, you's a fool, D-R</p>
